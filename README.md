# DSP filters

The library consists of three modules:
* fir_filter:  
providing the implementation of fft, FIR filter, windows and visualzation of frequency spectrum
* iir_filter:  
providing the implementation of dft, fft, FIR & IIR filter, conversion between Z and s domain and visualization of spectrum & zeros of transfer function
* rls:  
including the implementation of matrix, least mean squares (LMS) filter, recursive least squares (RLS) filter and frequency tracking
