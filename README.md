# DSP_method

The library consists of threee module:
* fir_filter(optional):  
provide implementation of fft, FIR filter, windows and visualzation of frequency spectrum
* iir_filter:  
provide implementation of dft, fft, FIR & IIR filter, conversion between Z and s domain and visualization of spectrum and zeros of transfer function
* rls:  
provide implementation of matrix, least mean squares (LMS) filter, recursive least squares (RLS) filter and frequency tracking
